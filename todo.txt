For v0.3.0
* Editor can place enemies, characters, objects - done
* Editor can save levels - done
* Game can load saved levels - done
* Treasure chests and gold tracking
* Maybe another type of enemy?
Would like to have:
* Combat turns
* Enemies/characters defined by data (makes it much easier to add new ones in later on)
* Some basic structure for equipment.
