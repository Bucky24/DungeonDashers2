So there are base files for a map, then there is save game data. The save game data will only contain changes to the original base game. IE characters/monsters moved around, objects, etc. So we only need to store those things.

Probably easier to when you save, just make a copy of characters, objects, monsters, etc, and save that. Then, when loading that data, we can overwrite those properties in the base file completely.
