This is meant to be rough notes on how triggers work, for internal development (otherwise I'll get confused). Once the system is more finalized, I will need to make a new system.

General structure:

{
	"id": <number>,
	"conditions": [
		{
			"type": "<type of condition>",
			"data": {
				...necessary data for the condition
			}
		}
	],
	"effects": [
		{
			"type": "<type of effect>",
			"data": {
				...necessary data for the effect
			}
		}
	],
	"repeats": <false|true>,
}

Repeats:

Determines if the trigger repeats or not. If it does not repeat, it will fire once then never again.

Conditions:

variableCheck - compares two game variables

	data:

	variable (see below for variables) - the variable to check
	operator - the operator to use for the check. Support for == right now
	comparisonVariable (see below) - the variable to compare the first one with

mapTriggerTriggered - has an on-map trigger been triggered?

	data:

	triggerID - the ID of the trigger object
	character - boolean, if true a character can trigger this trigger
	enemy - boolean, if true an enemy can trigger this trigger

Effects:

winGame - triggers the game win condition

	data: none

gamePause - sets if game is paused or none

	data:

	pause - boolean, indicates if game is paused

centerCamera - centers the camera on a specific point

	data:

	x - the cell x to center on
	y - the cell y to center on

resetCamera - sets the camera to center on the active character

	data: none

showDialog - shows a dialog with a given portrait

	text - the text to show
	characterIdent - the character ident to show a picture for

spawnCharacter - creates the character (if it doesn't exist already) at the given woords

	ident - the ident of the character to create
	x - the x position to spawn the character at
	y - the y position to spawn the character at

setActiveCharacter - sets the given character as active

	ident - the ident of the character to switch to

Variables:

totalCharacters - the total characters the player started with
totalCharactersAlive - the total characters the player currently has
charactersOnPortal - the total number of characters that are standing on a portal
