This is meant to be rough notes on how triggers work, for internal development (otherwise I'll get confused). Once the system is more finalized, I will need to make a new system.

General structure:

{
	"conditions": [
		{
			"type": "<type of condition>",
			"data": {
				...necessary data for the condition
			}
		}
	],
	"effects": [
		{
			"type": "<type of effect>",
			"data": {
				...necessary data for the effect
			}
		}
	]
}

Conditions:

variableCheck - compares two game variables

data:

variable (see below for variables) - the variable to check
operator - the operator to use for the check. Support for == right now
comparisonVariable (see below) - the variable to compare the first one with

Effects:

winGame - triggers the game win condition

data: none

Variables:

totalCharacters - the total characters the player started with
totalCharactersAlive - the total characters the player currently has
charactersOnPortal - the total number of characters that are standing on a portal
