* Sir Jacob gets stopped by opened doors when using special
* Ryder's special can teleport to unwalkable spaces
* Characters should be able to move through each other as long as they have action points to move afterwards.
* Ryder should be disabled in combat while Sir Jacob is fighting before he sees Ryder
* Quit button doesn't do anything (quit app)
* Closing the electron window keeps the process alive still
* Doors are centered wrong in their square
* It's possible for Ryder to finish map 1 because when he blinks from 1 pad to the other the collision happens on both!
